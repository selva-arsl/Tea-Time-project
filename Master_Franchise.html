                        <p>A master franchisee's ways of generating income are expanded over that of a normal franchise.  In a normal franchise, product or service is directly offered to the end-consumer such as retail store, whereas a master franchisee can generate income through own stores with a significantly reduced royalty and franchise fee.  The rewards and return on investment is three-fold.  When a franchise is sold in their territory the master franchisee recevies a percentage of the franchise fee.  They also share in the monthly royalty revenue each franchisee pays to the franchisor.  This is most significant component of the reward.  As the master franchisee build our their territory adding more and more franchisees, this monthly revenue stream grows.</p>

                     <li>
                        <p>The third revenue stream will be from the unity they own, which in many cases will be their own multiple units.</p>
                     
                     </li>
                      

                     <li>
                      <p>Taking a Master Franchise in India can be extremely beneficial in terms of the return on Investment, brand recognition and the unmatched support provided by the parent company.
